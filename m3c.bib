	doi = {10.1186/1747-597X-5-19},
	abstract = {Background: Previous literature has shown a divergence by age in the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and substance use: adolescents with low SES are more likely to engage in substance use, as are adults with high SES. However, there is growing evidence that adolescents with high SES are also at high risk for substance abuse. The objective of this study is to examine this relationship longitudinally, that is, whether wealthier adolescents are more likely than those with lower SES to engage in substance use in early adulthood. Methods: The study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), a longitudinal, nationally-representative survey of secondary school students in the United States. Logistic regression models were analyzed examining the relationship between adolescent SES (measured by parental education and income) and substance use in adulthood, controlling for substance use in adolescence and other covariates. Results: Higher parental education is associated with higher rates of binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine use in early adulthood. Higher parental income is associated with higher rates of binge drinking and marijuana use. No statistically significant results are found for crystal methamphetamine or other drug use. Results are not sensitive to the inclusion of college attendance by young adulthood as a sensitivity analysis. However, when stratifying by race, results are consistent for white non-Hispanics, but no statistically significant results are found for non-whites. This may be a reflection of the smaller sample size of non-whites, but may also reflect that these trends are driven primarily by white non-Hispanics. Conclusions: Previous research shows numerous problems associated with substance use in young adults, including problems in school, decreased employment, increases in convictions of driving under the influence (DUI) and accidental deaths. Much of the previous literature is focused on lower SES populations. Therefore, it is possible that teachers, parents and school administrators in wealthier schools may not perceive as great to address substance abuse treatment in their schools. This study can inform teachers, parents, school administrators and program officials of the need for addressing drug abuse prevention activities to this population of students.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine what substances US youth vape. Methods Data come from Monitoring the Future, an annual, nationally representative survey of USA 12th-grade, 10th-grade and 8th-grade students. Respondents reported what substance they vaped the last time they used a vaporiser such as an e-cigarette. Results Among students who had ever used a vaporiser, 65–66\% last used ‘just ﬂavouring’ in 12th, in 10th and in 8th grade, more than all other responses combined. In all three grades, the percentage using ‘just ﬂavouring’ was above 57\% for males, females, AfricanAmericans, Hispanics, Whites, and students both with and without a parent with a college degree. Nicotine use came in a distant second, at about 20\% in 12th and 10th grade and 13\% in 8th grade. Taking into account youth who vaped nicotine at last use increases national estimates of tobacco/nicotine prevalence in the past 30 days by 24–38\% above and beyond cigarette smoking, which is substantial but far less than estimates that assume all vaporiser users inhale nicotine. Conclusions These results challenge the common assumption that all vaporiser users inhale nicotine. They (a) call into question the designation of vaporisers and e-cigarettes as ENDS (‘Electronic Nicotine Delivery System’), (b) suggest that the recent rise in adolescent vaporiser use does not necessarily indicate a nicotine epidemic, and (c) indicate that vaporiser users can be candidates for primary prevention programmes. Finally, the results suggest the importance of developing different rationales for the regulation of vaporiser devices as compared to the regulation of substances marketed for vaporiser use.},

	abstract = {Methods: Using data from a variety of sources, alcohol-attributable deaths and nonfatal hospitalizations for illnesses and injuries were calculated for California for the year 2006. Results: Excessive alcohol use resulted in over 10,000 deaths and 72,000 nonfatal hospitalizations in California. The majority of consequences (51\%) were due to chronic illnesses associated with long-term excessive use of alcohol. Overall, males reported more deaths and nonfatal hospitalizations due to excessive alcohol use than women. Alcohol-attributable deaths and hospitalizations are more likely to occur among individuals aged 50-64 years for illnesses and individuals aged 20-34 years for injuries. Older individuals suffered from more chronic conditions such as alcoholic liver disease, while younger individuals were more likely to suffer from injuries, the most common being motor-vehicle traffic crashes. Significant differences in the rate of deaths and nonfatal hospitalizations by race/ethnicity were more common due to injuries and violence than chronic diseases. Conclusions: This study highlighted key findings of demographic differences in consequences suffered by excessive alcohol use in California. Continued efforts to better evaluate the contribution of alcohol to morbidity and mortality by demographic factors, especially by race and ethnicity, is warranted to prevent and reduce the harm associated with this behavior.},

	abstract = {Objectives To examine trends and correlates of cannabis-involved emergency department (ED) visits in the United States from 2004 to 2011. Methods Data were obtained from the 2004-2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network. We analyzed trend in cannabis-involved ED visits for persons aged ≥12 years and stratified by type of cannabis involvement (cannabis-only, cannabis-polydrug). We used logistic regressions to determine correlates of cannabis-involved hospitalization versus cannabis-involved ED visits only. Results Between 2004 and 2011, the ED visit rate increased from 51 to 73 visits per 100,000 population aged ≥ 12 years for cannabis-only use (P-value for trend=0.004) and from 63 to 100 for cannabis-polydrug use (P-value for trend{\textbackslash}textless0.001). Adolescents aged 12-17 years showed the largest increase in the cannabis-only-involved ED visit rate (Rate difference=80 per 100,000 adolescents). Across racial/ethnic groups, the most prevalent ED visits were noted among non-Hispanic blacks. Among cannabis-involved visits, the odds of hospitalization (versus ED visits only) increased with age strata compared with aged 12-17 years. Conclusions These findings suggest a notable increase in the ED visit numbers and rates for both the use of cannabis-only and cannabis-polydrug during the studied period, particularly among young people and non-Hispanic blacks.},

	abstract = {In this paper we examine the incremental cost of marijuana comorbidity for alcohol, mood and thought diagnoses in hospital settings. We use data from the 1993–2000 National Hospital Discharge Survey to examine the effect on length of stay and the 1995–2000 Florida Hospital Discharge Data to examine charges. General Linear Modeling (GLM) and propensity score methods are employed to deal with concerns stemming from the distribution of the dependent variables and statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics of marijuana users versus non-users. Marijuana comorbidity is associated with longer length of stays and higher charges for patients suffering from a primary diagnosis of an alcohol problem. We also find higher average charges for patients suffering from mood disorders, though the finding is not robust across all model specifications. We do not find any significant effects for thought disorders. Findings from this study suggest that a marijuana comorbidity increases the cost of treating patients with alcohol problems and mood disorder diagnoses, implying that there may be real health consequences associated with marijuana abuse and dependence and more work considering this possibility is warranted.},

	abstract = {Not since the HIV/AIDS epidemic has the United States faced as devastating and lethal a health problem as the current crisis of opioid misuse and overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD). Current national trends indicate that each year more people die of overdoses—the majority of which involve opioid drugs—than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, the Korean War, or any armed conflict since the end of World War II. Each day 90 Americans die prematurely from an overdose that involves an opioid (Rudd et al., 2016b), leaving families and friends bereft. The opioid epidemic's toll is felt across the life span and in every sociodemographic group, but more heavily burdens vulnerable populations, such as those in economically depressed areas of the country. This chapter updates key statistics regarding use and misuse of prescription opioids, identifies risk factors for opioid-related harms, describes the recent increase in use of heroin and illicitly manufactured synthetic opioids and its relation to the prescription opioid epidemic, describes the impact of prescription opioids on illicit markets, reviews the current state of surveillance systems, and summarizes recent trends in treatment of OUD and use of naloxone to prevent overdose deaths. The committee selected these topics to discuss in particular for their relevance to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) exercise of its authority to regulate pharmaceutical opioid products (analgesics, agonists, and antagonists). Each aspect of this chapter identifies considerations that should be taken into account when weighing the societal perspective and public health impact relevant to these products when they are being considered for new drug approval or during post-market surveillance.},
